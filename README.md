![ScreenShot](main.png)

## Description

This is a On-Call Tracker software system built for the CS2043 Software Engineering project at the University of New Brunswick.
The objective of  the project is to design and build a software tool which will help a school assign teachers to classes that need coverage due to absences.

## Instructions
1. Update all the Absences in Absence.xlsx file.
2. Run the Driver Program with the date and the week assignments are required.

## Algorithm

If Supply teachers are provided, priority is given to supply teachers and use them efficiently and if they are not provided priority goes for the regular teachers. If the regulare teachers have the same priority, teachers are assigned based on there teacher ID which is generated by the system. (We assume the teachers who joined the school ealier has a lower value ID and the teachers that has higher ID has higher value ID. For instance, A teacher that has ID-100 joined the school first and the teacher has ID-101 joined later (Based on Seniority)).

## Features
